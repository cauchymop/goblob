- In Progress
   - Continue InGame Actions: Now playMode is broken, Pass/Pass crashes
   - Rename InGameView as it does more than the InGame phase (or rename phase?)

Debugging:
- playing a game (alternating moves) is flaky if 2 remote players on same device.

In progress:
    - Continue to dummify all subviews of InGameView.

Next:
- When only an expired game is left in the cache, starting the app shows that game with only
  "new game" in the combo. We should keep the finished/expired/deleted games somewhere.
- allow replay of a finished game
- Espresso tests
- Popup local/remote
- In GameRepository: multiple local games
- GridLayout
- Thanks to GameRepository: espresso tests

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode

Crazy projects:
- cardboard
- TV (chromecast, TV)
- Wear
- IA
