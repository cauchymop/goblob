In progress:
- BoardView/BoardViewModel done.
- Continue to dummify all subviews of GameFragment and ConfigurationFragment
- Introduce new GameFragment that will contain the InGameView and ConfigurationView (fragments) and display the proper one form set GameViewModel (gameData for now)
- TO REMEMBER:
  - GameData is an "acting" ViewModel to init the GameView for now until we create a proper GameViewModel
  - We still pass it to the InGameView and Configuration for now but we will pass specific InGameViewModel and ConfigurationViewModel
  - We only have one big GamePresenter which implements specific listeners interfaces and knows how to create ViewModels for all Views


- Move to MVP, where the Activity is in charge of building instances and connecting them:
  - It build instances of subviews, and make them know their presenter
  - It build instances of view containers, and them know their presenter and subviews

- Initial notes:
  - new GameFragment which can display any state
  - the activity creates:
    - the top level view
    - the top level presenter (giving the top level view)
  - the top level view has 2 subviews (configuration and ingame)
  - solution 1: the top level presenter fetches the current subview, and gives it to the current sub-presenter it creates.
  - solution 2: the top level presenter gives the right subpresenter to the toplevel view (showConfiguration(ConfigurationPresenter))
- Or move to MVVM using Google Data Binding

Next:
- When only an expired game is left in the cache, starting the app shows that game with only
  "new game" in the combo. We should keep the finished/expired/deleted games somewhere.
- allow replay of a finished game
- Espresso tests
- Popup local/remote
- In GameRepository: multiple local games
- GridLayout
- Thanks to GameRepository: espresso tests

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode

Crazy projects:
- cardboard
- TV (chromecast, TV)
- Wear
- IA
