- In Progress
   - TODO: Refresh problem when receiving a game in configuration phase
     - steps to reproduce: create a local game with specific names, then create a remote game: the configuration view contains the old specific names.
     - Local Game + Local does not seem to have the bug (just Local + Remote)
     - Local + Local in debug still showed the old value before changing it to the model one
     - The Presenter creation in onCreateView is what triggers the setConfigurationViewModel call
     - Still nothing explains the bug (we may have too many views, but maybe not)
     - Using the profiler, ConfigurationView seem to be garbaged correctly in Local + Local case, not tested Local + Remote case (TODO)
     - TODO: implement onSavedInstanceState on customeViews for rotation (probably only GameConfigurationView needs it)

   - TODO: Keyboard onFocus is not enough on Configuration
   - TODO: Center Message in InGameView
   - TODO: Finish InGame Current Player View (Icon and Color)
   - TODO: InGame Actions from menu
   - TODO: Rename InGameView as it does more than the InGame phase (or rename phase?)

Events:
- Add an event for login to play games

Debugging:
- playing a game (alternating moves) is flaky if 2 remote players on same device.

In progress:
    - Continue to dummify all subviews of InGameView.

Next:
- When only an expired game is left in the cache, starting the app shows that game with only
  "new game" in the combo. We should keep the finished/expired/deleted games somewhere.
- allow replay of a finished game
- Espresso tests
- Popup local/remote
- In GameRepository: multiple local games
- GridLayout
- Thanks to GameRepository: espresso tests

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode

Crazy projects:
- cardboard
- TV (chromecast, TV)
- Wear
- IA
